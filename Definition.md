* Programming language used in project: Python
* I also know Javascript and Typescript for peer-to-peer review
* I will be using the Minimax algorithm to develop and AI that solves the 2048 game.
* The Minimax algorithm maximizes the user's possibilities of winning whilst simultaneously minimizing loss. The algorithm uses a heuristic evaluation function that determines the board state and which next move gives us the next most optimal state whilst avoidind the bad moves. 
* The user doesn't make inputs in this game, it is an AI that solves it. There might be an option also for the user to play without the AI.

* The desired time complexity in this adaptation is O(n^m) where:
    - n is the branching factor
    - m is the depth that the game tree is looking in, the number of moves ahead that the AI searches.
