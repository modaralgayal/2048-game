## Week 2

* Almost the entirety of the 2048 game is now coded and ready. There a few bugs when the game ends which i need help with. Otherwise the game works and tracks score. User interface looks very good.

* The functionality is split into their own respective modules and run from a gameloop module, that way testing the app is much easier and the quality is better.

* The game is now Playable by users, the game now looks very similair to the original version. 

* I have a few bugs that are confusing me in the game logic as to why my code is not working. I will ask for help regarding them.

* I have not yet made an AI with the min-max algorithm. Next up i need to fix the bugs in the code and start implementing the AI that solves the game.

* Now that i have made the game easy to play and made the input moves testable, I can also make the AI make the moves by generating the best possible "input" given by the AI.
