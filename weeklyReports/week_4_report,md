# Week 4


* I fixed fundemental error in the logic of the game itself. At one the game make error in the coordinations of the tiles leaving the game to make errors in placement and ultimately playing the game wrong. Now there are no more errors in placement.

* Continued exploring the best possible heuristic functions for this game, it now runs comfortably on depth 4 and solves almost 100% of the time the tile 2048.

* Next only a more pleasant UI is needed to be programmed, so the user can the game itself or the AI from the same interface.
