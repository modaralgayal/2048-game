# Week 5

- Spent the week testing the best possible combinations for pruning the amount of tiles explored plus depth, figured the a depth of 6 and pruning to only test the top 3 most valuable tiles based on the heuristic value is the best combination. The algorithm regularly solves up to 4096 and almost certainly solves until 20248.
