## Week 1

* I became familiar with the Minimax theory and what the adaptations of it can look like in the 2048 game. Check the Definition document for references.

* Initialized project and wrote the Definition document.

* I had a conversation with the professor about my idea and got a better understanding of what I want to do.

* Next up I need to initialize my project and install the needed dependencies, as well as initialize testing for my code. I have to create a heuristic function that can analyze the value of the current game situation.
