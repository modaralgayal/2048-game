# 2048 AI

* The AI was implemented using Expectiminimax algorithm with depth of 6, but the algorithm looks at only the 3 most valuable tiles and determines movements around their placement. This pruning speeds up the gameplay. The tile movement seems to be time taxing so i figured it a good solution. The game brings good results as well, almost always solving 2048 and sometimes 4096.
